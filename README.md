# CMSC421Team1

For each task you work on (you can break down tasks)
1) Create a branch
2) Once you are done with your code, create a pull request
3) Assign 1 or 2 people from the team that you want code review from
4) Make sure to solve all merge conflicts
5) After getting approval, merge branch into main
6) Delete branch

Some to take note of:
1) Push as often as you can
2) Make small commits
3) Pull often
4) A hint when merging: git pull --rebase origin main
